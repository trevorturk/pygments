== Welcome

http://pygments.appspot.com is an unofficial API for the Pygments syntax highlighting library, version 1.5.
It's designed to provide syntax highlighting for web applications that don't have Python installed. 

== Usage

POST to http://pygments.appspot.com with "lang" and "code" parameters in the body. 
You'll receive pygmentized HTML back, which you can store for later display on your site.
You can style the pygmentized HTML using CSS like this: http://github.com/trevorturk/pygments/blob/master/default.css

== Ruby Example

$ irb

require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

lang = 'python'
code = 'print "Hello World"'

request = Net::HTTP.post_form(URI.parse('http://pygments.appspot.com/'), {'lang'=>lang, 'code'=>code})
puts request.body

== More Information

This site was created so that http://flowcoder.com could run on http://heroku.com, but please feel free to use it yourself.
If you like, you can fork the code on github and create your own Google App Engine site, though.
